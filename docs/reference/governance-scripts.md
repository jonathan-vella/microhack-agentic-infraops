Three PowerShell scripts manage the Azure Policy lifecycle for the microhack event.
All require the **Azure CLI** (`az`) and **PowerShell 7+** (`pwsh`), both pre-installed in the dev container.

> These scripts are **for facilitators only**. Participants do not need to run them.
{: .note }

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify tools are available
pwsh --version
az --version

# Log in and select the target subscription
az login
az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"

# Confirm the correct subscription is active
az account show --query "{Name:name, Id:id}" -o table
```

You need **Owner** or **Resource Policy Contributor** role on the subscription to create and delete policy assignments.

---

## Running the Scripts

Scripts are located in the `scripts/` folder of the repository you create from the [azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator template](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator).

Run from the **repository root**:

```bash
pwsh -File scripts/<script-name>.ps1 -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
```

Or navigate to the folder first:

```bash
cd scripts
pwsh -File ./Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
```

## Script Reference

### 1. Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1

[View source on GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator/blob/main/scripts/Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1)

**When to use:** Before the event starts, to deploy governance constraints that teams must work around.

Deploys eight `Deny`-effect policy assignments at the subscription scope. Assignments use the `microhack-` prefix
and are idempotent — existing assignments are skipped automatically.

#### Setup Parameters

| Parameter       | Required | Description                               |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `-Subscription` | Yes      | Azure subscription name or ID             |
| `-WhatIf`       | No       | Preview assignments without creating them |
| `-Verbose`      | No       | Show detailed progress per assignment     |

#### Setup Usage

```bash
# Preview first (always recommended)
pwsh -File scripts/Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 \
  -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>" \
  -WhatIf

# Deploy policies
pwsh -File scripts/Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 \
  -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"

# Deploy with verbose output
pwsh -File scripts/Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 \
  -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>" \
  -Verbose
```

### 2. Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1

[View source on GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator/blob/main/scripts/Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1)

**When to use:** Anytime — before, during, or after the event — to verify which policies are active
and their compliance state.

Lists policy assignments on the subscription and reports compliance counts from Azure Policy state.

| `-Verbose`      | No       | Show detailed progress                   |

#### Status Usage

```bash
# Check all policy assignments on the subscription
pwsh -File scripts/Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1 \
  -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"

# Check only microhack policies
pwsh -File scripts/Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1 \
  -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>" \
  -MicrohackOnly
```

#### Status Output

...
```

> If `State` shows `Unknown`, compliance data is still being collected. Wait a few minutes and re-run.

### 3. Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1

[View source on GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator/blob/main/scripts/Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1)

**When to use:** After the event ends, to restore the subscription to its pre-event state.

Finds and deletes all policy assignments with the `microhack-` prefix. Supports `-WhatIf` to preview removals before committing.

# Remove all microhack policies
pwsh -File scripts/Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1 \
  -Subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
```

#### Removal Output

```text
Subscription   : my-subscription-name
SubscriptionId : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Removed        : 8
Failed         : 0

## Recommended Event Sequence

```bash
SUB="<your-subscription-name-or-id>"

# 1. Before the event — deploy governance
pwsh -File scripts/Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -Subscription $SUB -WhatIf
pwsh -File scripts/Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -Subscription $SUB

# 2. Verify policies are active (run after 5–15 min)
pwsh -File scripts/Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1 -Subscription $SUB -MicrohackOnly

# 3. After the event — remove governance
pwsh -File scripts/Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -Subscription $SUB -WhatIf
pwsh -File scripts/Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1 -Subscription $SUB
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                            | Cause                               | Solution                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `command not found: pwsh`          | PowerShell not installed            | Run `which pwsh`; it should be pre-installed in devcontainer |
| `az: command not found`            | Azure CLI not installed             | Azure CLI is pre-installed; try `az login`                   |
| `AuthorizationFailed`              | Insufficient role                   | Ensure Owner or Resource Policy Contributor on sub           |
| Assignment creation fails silently | Policy definition ID changed        | Check definition IDs via `az policy definition list`         |
| Policy not blocking deployments    | Propagation delay                   | Wait 5–15 minutes after `Setup-GovernancePolicies.ps1`       |
| `State: Unknown` in status output  | Compliance data not yet collected   | Wait a few minutes and re-run `Get-GovernanceStatus.ps1`     |
| Assignments remain after cleanup   | `Failed` count > 0 in Remove output | Re-run `Remove-GovernancePolicies.ps1`; check RBAC           |
